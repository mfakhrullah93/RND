# Creating a gRPC microservice focused on company finance. 

**Here are a few ideas for finance-related microservices tailored for companies.**

1. **Accounting Service**: Manage general ledger entries, accounts payable, and accounts receivable.

2. **Payroll Service**: Handle employee salaries, bonuses, deductions, and tax calculations.

3. **Expense Management Service**: Track and manage company expenses, approvals, and reimbursements.

4. **Budgeting Service**: Help create, track, and manage company budgets, forecasts, and financial planning.

5. **Invoicing Service**: Generate, send, and track invoices for clients and manage payments received.

6. **Financial Reporting Service**: Generate financial statements, balance sheets, income statements, and other financial reports.

7. **Cash Flow Management Service**: Track and manage the companyâ€™s cash flow, including incoming and outgoing cash.

8. **Asset Management Service**: Track company assets, depreciation, and asset valuation.

9. **Tax Compliance Service**: Manage tax filings, compliance with regulations, and tax reporting.

10. **Audit Service**: Provide tools for internal and external auditing, ensuring compliance with financial standards.

### Proto Generate Example:-
> `protoc --proto_path=. --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative protos/accounting-service.proto`

> `protoc --proto_path=. --go-grpc_out=. protos/accounting-service.proto`

### grpcurl Command:-
> **List all method of the service**: `grpcurl --plaintext localhost:1993 list`

> **Describe method**: `grpcurl --plaintext localhost:1993 describe accounting.AccountingService.ListLedgerEntries`

> **Test calling method with parameter**: `grpcurl --plaintext -d '{"start_date":"02022024","end_date":"03032024"}' localhost:1993 accounting.AccountingService/ListLedgerEntries`

### Run Services
> **Accounting**: `go run ./cmd/accounting`

> **Invoicing**: `go run ./cmd/invoicing`

`Note: Maybe this services dont need to be in gRPC.`

`Todo: Make them as library instead.`
